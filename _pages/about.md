Analyst. Cosmology PhD. Red panda enthusiast. Black belt. Amateur musician.

## Professional

I received my BS with a double major in physics and astronomy from The Ohio State University in May 2014. I then went to the University of Arizona for grad school where I worked with Dr. Eduardo Rozo in the physics department. I completed my PhD in October 2020, and the title of my dissertation was [Enabling Galaxy Clustering and Dynamics as Tools of Precision Cosmology](/publications/wagoner_2020).

While at Ohio State, I spent the summer of 2012 working with the [Ohio State Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) group](https://www.asc.ohio-state.edu/physics/cms/). In 2013, I began working with Dr. Jennifer Johnson and Dr. Sarah Schmidt in the Department of Astronomy as part of the [Summer Undergraduate Research Program in Astrophysics](https://astronomy.osu.edu/undergraduates/undergraduate-research/surp), and I continued working with them through July 2014. That project was working to callibrate the relationship between color, temperature, and metallicity for M dwarf stars with high-resolution spectra. The goal was to then use that relation to search for low-metallicity M dwarfs in data with lower resolution spectra but for which many more stars were observed. This research resulted in several posters and my [undergraduate thesis](/publications/wagoner_2014), and a continuation of the project including a second year of data as well as a cross match between three different surveys resulted in my first [paper](/publications/schmidt_et_al_2016).

The bulk of my research as a graduate student focused on galaxy clustering cosmology, especially in photometric galaxy surveys such as the [Dark Energy Survey (DES)](https://www.darkenergysurvey.org) and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory [Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST)](https://www.lsst.org). My projects included developing a new method to use galaxies with photometric redshifts for baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) analyses (for a nice description of BAO, see [here](http://w.astro.berkeley.edu/~mwhite/bao/)), mitigating the effects of observing conditions on the observed galaxy density, and a developing and forecasting a novel way to measure the Hubble constant.

As a grad student, I also worked in the DES collaboration as well as the [Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC)](https://lsstdesc.org) of LSST, primarily within the large scale structure working group of each.

I finished my PhD in 2020, and started working in industry in 2021. I currently work at Stellar Science Ltd Co, for which I work as an analyst working in AI/ML, and sometimes doing space-related things. I am most proud of the Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) projects for which I have helped and/or led proposals and those for which I have led the project. These include several in reinforcement learning (RL) as well as one in image processing. I have also joined the recruitment team, which has taught me a lot as well.


## Personal
I studied karate for 6 years while in grade school, and attained the rank of third degree black belt. In addition to this, I was an instructor, especially for the kid's program at my karate school. I'm currently looking to start up some form of martial arts again.

I love music, and I play flute, piccolo, and some piano.

I am an occaisonal knitter, although I always feel guilty that I don't spend more time on it.

Red pandas are my favorite animal ever! They are just so adorable, especially sleeping in a tree using their tails as a blanket. My boyfriend and I enjoy traveling to different zoos (especially with red pandas), and we have also done a wildlife encounter with them. I donate/ask for people to make donation in my name to the red panda network, and think it would be awesome to go on one of their eco-trips in the future.
