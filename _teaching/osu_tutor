I was hired as a physics tutor by the physics department at Ohio State University. These positions were reserved primarily for undergraduates, with the occasional graduate student as needed. The tutoring was intended for students in the introductory physics sequence, mostly for the non-honors courses, both algebra and calculus based. As a tutor, I would help students with homework, and sometimes I would explain concepts they didn't understand from lectures or as a review before exams.
